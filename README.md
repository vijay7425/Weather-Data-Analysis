# Weather Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing weather data to gain insights into various weather patterns and trends. The dataset contains information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation for a specific location over a period of time.

## Dataset
The weather dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. It includes features such as:
- Date: The date of the recorded weather data.
- Location: The location for which the weather data is recorded.
- MinTemp: The minimum temperature recorded for the day.
- MaxTemp: The maximum temperature recorded for the day.
- Rainfall: The amount of rainfall recorded for the day.
- WindGustSpeed: The maximum wind gust speed recorded for the day.
- Humidity: The humidity recorded for the day.
- WindSpeed: The average wind speed recorded for the day.
- Pressure: The atmospheric pressure recorded for the day.
- RainToday: Whether it rained or not on that day.

## Analysis
1. Data Exploration: The dataset is explored to understand its structure and contents.
2. Data Processing: Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are applied if necessary.


## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
